A service that lets people make simulations of whole systems and share them with their friends. The focus is on economic and environmental systems that are simple enough to run in a browser. The current incarnation is flow based rather than say based on a cellular automata. Later it may make sense to add gpu based simulation for finer granularity models.

There is also an accompanying essay, info on other projects that are similar, relevant articles, books and links.

todo

thesis
  - needs to be refactored and laid out
  - needs a community to take a few passes at it to clean up the ideas there
  - needs a community to add links and other relevant media

simulator
  - needs to be finished; it's very incomplete - and only one of multiple simulators i hope to see

site overall
  - need to add some kind of navigation concept so users can go back to the previous page more easily
  - probably should urlify all urls so that urls can be cut and pasted to mobile devices without spaces ruining things
  - some sub-areas in the thesis/essay section may want different layouts to relieve eye tedium
