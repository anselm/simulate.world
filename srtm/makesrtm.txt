Cleaned up SRTM data can be obtained from here. The resolution is greater than you would need for viewing state sized data segments on a screen.

Hereâ€™s one way to merge them together - using gdalwarp

Here is another way - using gdal_merge 

	/opt/local/share/examples/py27-gdal/scripts/gdal_merge.py srtm_12_04.tif srtm_12_05.tif srtm_12_06.tif srtm_13_05.tif srtm_13_06.tif srtm_14_06.tif -o big.tif

Here are shape file outlines that you can use to cut an image against in order to get only a single state:

Here is how a shape file can cut a tiff

	gdalwarp -cutline test.shp -crop_to_cutline -dstalpha big.tif clipped.tif

And here is how to lower their resolution

	gdalwarp -ts 1600 0 -r cubic -co "TFW=YES" srtm_12_05.tif test.tif

I have a small program that converts them to obj files in blender. It also removes spikes.

From there you might want to assign a UV,  remove any unused vertices, smooth and decimate as desired.
