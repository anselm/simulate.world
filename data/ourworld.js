Letâ€™s take a deep breath and consider our home.\n\
\n\
The first photographs of our whole planet were taken in 1967. In a sense that marks the beginning of an awareness that we are a single ecosystem.\n\
\n\
As far as we know this Earth is the only place in the universe that has life. Beautiful for its own reasons, for its diversity and complexity, it may also be unique.\n\
\n\
This world shapes us. We are warmed by the same sun, breath the same air. Simple acts such as eating food or drinking water are connected to an extraordinary chain of phenomena. Even our awareness is sensate, our reasoning and values are shaped by this world. And just as the world shaped us, we are now beginning to shape it.\n\

Each of our experiences are unique. We each touch a different part of the world and together those experiences may contribute to a larger picture. Some of us grew up near mountains, others in cities, some on the prairies, or in small towns or along coasts with beaches. As a result we each value different things.\n\
