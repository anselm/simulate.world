Letâ€™s take a deep breath and consider our world.\n\
\n\
In 1967 the first photographs of our planet were transmitted back to Earth. It wasn't long after that James Lovelock who worked at JPL coined the phrase <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis'><font color=blue>'Gaia Theory'</font></a> to describe his perception of our planet as a single self-regulating organism. He suggested that all of life on Earth worked in concert to maximize biodiversity and life as we know it.\n\
\n\
As far as we know the thin surface of this Earth is the only place in the universe that has life. Beautiful for its own reasons, for its diversity and complexity, it may also be unique.\n\

"\
We are warmed by the same sun, breath the same air. Simple acts such as eating food or drinking water are connected to an extraordinary chain of phenomena. Even our awareness is sensate, our reasoning and values are shaped by this world.\n\
\n\
Yet each of our experiences are unique. We each touch a different part of the world and together those experiences may contribute to a larger picture. Some of us grew up near mountains, others in cities, some on the prairies, or in small towns or along coasts with beaches. As a result we each value different things.\n\

What are your most powerful memories? How many of your own most vivid memories and experiences are of times that you spent exploring, hiking, climbing, running outside?

Do you feel our world is worth protecting? Is our world something you cherish and love? Or is it somehow damaged beyond repair? Do you think we have any power to save it? Or that we need to?\n\

I feel it is important to stay focused on what we actually care about and what outcomes we wish for our world. The media and other voices have many dissonant opinions. In navigating these issues it helps to have defined our core values.\n\
