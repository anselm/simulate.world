Let’s take a deep breath and consider our beautiful world.

The earth is the only place in the universe that has life as far as we know. It is beautiful for its own reasons: simply for the diversity and complexity of the natural systems within it.

This apprehension is fairly new however - it wasn’t even until 1967 that we actually even saw our world as a whole for the first time. In a sense that marks the beginning of a global awareness.

We live in this space together, breathing together, having the sun warm our skins. Even simple acts such as eating food or drinking water are deeply connected to an extraordinary chain of phenomena. So much of our awareness is sensate, even our reason and values comes from a close contact with nature.

Each of our experiences are unique. We each touch a different part of the world and together those experiences may combine and contribute to a larger picture. Some of us grew up near mountains, others in cities, some on the prairies, or in small towns or along coasts with beaches. As a result we each value different things.

How many of your own most vivid memories and experiences are of times that you spent exploring, hiking, climbing, running outside? How many camping trips do you remember as opposed to times at the office? Are your dreams most often of spending more time in nature or more time indoors working on projects?

I myself grew up near the Rocky Mountains in Alberta and spent much of my youth climbing and hiking in those mountains. My own appreciation for the world is shaped by these memories.

I feel it’s just important to keep what we care about in mind as we look more closely at some of the challenges we face. Do you feel it is worth protecting? That it is something you cherish and love? Or is it somehow damaged beyond repair? Do you think we have any power to save it? Or that we need to?
