The Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta is similar to the Louisiana Delta but not quite as well recognized. It occupies about 1100 square miles, begins at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and ends at the bay. It’s been around for about 10,000 years, since the end of the last Ice Age, and was originally a large freshwater marsh with many shallow channels and sloughs surrounding islands of peat and tule. Agriculture has claimed most of the region and now the delta is actually below sea-level and protected by levees. It’s also a source for most of the water supply for central and southern California. There are 22 species of fish including Pacific Salmon, striped bass, steelhead trout, American shad and sturgeon. Of particular interest The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has found that the San Francisco Bay-Delta Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of longfin smelt is a key indicator species for the health of the Delta’s ecosystem. The smelt mainly inhabit the freshwater-saltwater mixing zone of the estuary, except during its spawning season, when it migrates upstream to freshwater following winter 'first flush' flow events (around March to May). Because of its one-year lifecycle and relatively low fecundity, it is very susceptible to changes in the environmental conditions of its native habitat. Efforts to protect the endangered fish from further decline have focused on limiting or modifying the large-scale pumping activities of state and federal water projects at the southern end of the estuary. Although allegations have been made that this protection has hurt California's agricultural sector, with the devastation of hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the Central Valley, a 2009 United States Department of Agriculture study estimated that job losses due to smelt protection were closer to 5,000.",

  notes:
"BP Oil Disaster. In 2010 the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded and sank and a sea-floor oil gusher flowed into the Gulf of Mexico for 87 days. The total discharge was estimated to be 4.9 million barrels. A massive response ensued to protect beaches, wetlands and estuaries. This included skimmer ships, floating booms, controlled burns and 1.84 million US gallons of Corexit oil dispersant. Extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats and fishing and tourism industries was reported. Dolphins and other marine life died in record numbers. Tuna and amberjack exposed to oil developed deformities of the heart and other organs. BP, like many private organizations, has digital simulations of systems that they exploit. They almost certainly also had models of local ecosystem impacts of oil-spills. In either case these models were not public. If there had been civic models then local policy about safety policies and drilling techniques may have been more rigorous or entirely disallowed. If local fishermen, tourist agencies and other regional stakeholders had a clear understanding of the liabilities and even just the economic risks, there may have been much more concerted opposition to the building of these wells."

  notes:
"The Grand Coulee Dam flooded 21,000 acres of prime bottom land where Native Americans had been living and hunting for thousands of years. Because it lacks a fish ladder the dam permanently blocked fish migration, removing over 1,100 mi (1,770 km) of natural spawning habitat. Kettle Falls, once a primary Native American fishing grounds, was inundated. The average catch of over 600,000 salmon per year was eliminated. In one study, the Army Corps of Engineers estimated the annual loss was over 1 million fish. Chinook, Steelhead, Sockeye and Coho salmon, as well as other important species including Lamprey, are now unable to spawn in the reaches of the Upper Columbia Basin. The general feeling at the time was that the vast economic gains to be derived from the project should not be endangered by the consideration of fish. North of the border Canada appeared to have been truly indifferent to the loss of salmon and steelhead from the Columbia River. The official position was that “there is no commercial salmon fishery on the Columbia River, and hence Canadian interests in that respect will not be affected if the dam at Grand Coulee is not equipped with fishway facilities”. Basically the Canadian government wrote off Columbia River salmon because there would be no adverse economic impact from their loss. Just by way of looking at hidden impacts there are many parks in the interior British Columbia watersheds that have the name “Grizzly” in them; presumably named for a time when these bears populated the region. Grizzly tend to be an indicator species. Similar to now extinct Mammoth and other megafauna the grizzly have a slow reproductive rate and are vulnerable to changes in habitat. It’s not entirely clear what the relationship is between grizzly and salmon but it is known that reduced salmon flows stress grizzly populations. It may very well be that the Grand Coulee wiped out the entire grizzly population in the region and nobody noticed."

"Recently the channel between Lake Merritt and the Oakland Estuary and San Francisco Bay has been re-opened. Lake Merritt was originally a brackish lagoon that swelled and shrank with the tide. It was home to otters, sea lions and migrating birds. However as the city grew the connection to the bay was closed, and sewage was pumped into the lake. The water became stagnant and noxious and wildlife fled. With the re-opening bacterial levels are at their lowest levels in years. Recently osprey and otter have been spotted as well."

  notes:
"The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has recently decided to allow a Nestlé bottled water plant in Cascade Locks. This was done without public review. Observers argue that although the water rights are held by the State that the water actually belongs to the people. Is selling this particular water a bad decision overall? Is there a water shortage? Would it be profitable to sell the water? Are there any unexpected consequences to wildlife or communities downstream? It’s a complex decision and a model that could test all outcomes may be helpful in arguing for or against the issue."

Balinese Water Temple Simulation\n\
\n\
Probably one of my favorite examples of civic simulations and the power of modeling is the essay on “Emergent Properties of Balinese Water Temples” by Steve Lansing. Steve happened to be in Bali during a time that the Balinese government was trying a new “intensive green agriculture”. The Green Revolution of the 1970’s brought a lot of new intensive farming techniques to communities around the world and for some reason these practices were failing in Bali. Steve built an actual computer simulation of the more traditional practices that the Balinese had been using and was able to show that the Green Revolution practices were actually not serving Bali. His thesis had a significant impact on government policy:\n\

"This is a another compelling example of intelligent local decision making in Bali. In this case fishermen agreed to create a fish bank that acted as a nature preserve where fish could grow larger. This helped fishermen overall and helped revive fish populations as well as tourism. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2wOxzD4aJE&noredirect=1",

  notes:
"\n\
A good example of unexpected consequences is the recent decision to reintroduce wolves into Yellowstone National Park. This had a significant impact on the local ecology including making the rivers run deeper and faster. The authors introduce the idea of a “trophic cascade” to explain how one change can have a deep effect on other parts of the system.\n\
\n\
If citizens in the Yellowstone bioregion had access to models that incorporated the facts, science and research of scientists in the region then it may have been possible to predict those outcomes prior to actually trying it.\n\
\n\
Reintroducing wolves is contentious because some farmers feel that wolves are a net negative (in that they kill livestock). This is a good example of where a better shared understanding between all stakeholders at a grassroots level would allow certain kinds of non-obvious decisions to be better agreed upon.\n\

"\n\
“The wells in Rajasthan’s Alwar District had dried up, thrusting the people into abject and seemingly inescapable poverty. The revival of traditional earthen dams to capture rainwater for recharging the underground water supply provided a tipping point that brought the wells back to life. And with the water came a better life for the people. It started in the spare, humble village of Gopalpura. Nearly a thousand villages are now following Gopalpura’s example.”\n\
\n\
http://www.ecotippingpoints.org/our-stories/indepth/india-rajasthan-rainwater-harvest-restoration-groundwater-johad.html\n\
\n\
This is an excellent example of how decisions can have impact at many levels. It also illuminates an often difficult to see association between poverty and environment. These people became poor because their environment was damaged. By finding ways to heal their watershed many of the traditions and values started to re-knit themselves back together.\n\
\n\
There are many more examples of this kind of work throughout the world. One of the groups working in on topics like this is https://www.digital-democracy.org/ .\n\
