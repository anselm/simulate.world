The Media Message and the projection of fear and powerlessness\n\
\n\
At the same time we also hear that the earth is at risk - and that we’re the cause.\n\
\n\
Think about the news stories you read or watch on the web every day. Are there any articles that talk about environmental crisis? What kinds of issues and topics do they focus on?\n\

It can feel like there is an avalanche of crisis. Climate change in general, aquifer exhaustion, ocean acidification, invasive species, habitat and diversity loss, drought, the great pacific plastic garbage gyre. We hear that corporate interests are cutting down the rainforests in the Amazon and Borneo, that monoculture farming is dangerous, that we’re relying on antibiotics too much, that low lying coastal regions are increasingly vulnerable to flood, that large scale refugee migrations may destabilize countries.\n\
\n\
We hear about tipping points, that methane hydrates trapped under the oceans may be released as our planet heats up and that we’ll smother to death under a methane sky.\n\
\n\
There’s an idea of “the sixth extinction”, that the earth has had many large extinctions previously, and that some were caused by similar kinds of self induced criticalities, and that this may just be another one of them on the geological scale. For example:\n\
\n\
It’s frightening but true: Our planet is now in the midst of its sixth mass extinction of plants and animals — the sixth wave of extinctions in the past half-billion years. We’re currently experiencing the worst spate of species die-offs since the loss of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Although extinction is a natural phenomenon, it occurs at a natural “background” rate of about one to five species per year. Scientists estimate we’re now losing species at 1,000 to 10,000 times the background rate, with literally dozens going extinct every day. It could be a scary future indeed, with as many as 30 to 50 percent of all species possibly heading toward extinction by mid-century.\n\

"\n\
Experts such as Steven Hawking exhort us to look at ways to get off planet - warning us that “it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster on earth in the next 100 years”.\n\
Everybody pulling in different directions; a sense of discord\n\
\n\
Not everybody hears the same message; we hear that different people in different communities are hearing different things. That environmental radicals are blocking important economic projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline, or that needless worries over CO2 emissions are making it hard for businesses to succeed. There is a sense of a hypothetical ‘other’ that we must fight.\n\
\n\
We have a many different values and traditions. Some of us were raised with Thoreau, others with Ayn Rand. There’s a wide range of opinions about what nature is and how we should act.\n\
\n\
At the end of the day different people react in different ways, depending on their upbringing, their culture, their values.\n\
\n\
As a result people appear to be split on different issues, on different points of view. There isn’t an underlying consistent sense of “how to fix things”. As people most affected by environmental change we are all primary stakeholders. Yet we are in conflict which each other and unable to act in concert. While we’re spit on our goals it feels like only private interests with more focus are able to pursue their own short term interests. Nobody actually wins.\n\
Existentialism Nihilism and Melancholia and other barriers to action\n\
\n\
There’s a product of the media, and a product of our dissonance, that it creates a certain kind of emotional reaction.\n\
\n\
When you think about what you hear in the media and you think about how wrong headed some peoples views seem to be - how does that make you feel? Is there a sense of frustration, or grief? Is there ambivalence? A sense of worry? Or do you just ignore it?\n\
\n\
It’s worth studying those emotions just for their own sake. By looking at how we feel, by creating valid emotional space around our own reactions, we can get clarity on how we choose to act. It is almost as if we need a planetary therapist.\n\
