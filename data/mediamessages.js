We hear a number of messages from the media. The first is that the Earth is a beautiful and special place. The second is that we, somehow, are responsible for destroying her.\n\
\n\
Think about the news stories or nature shows you read or watch every day. Are there any articles that talk about environmental crisis? What kinds of issues and topics do they focus on? What kinds of solutions do they focus on? How confident are you that we're going to tackle and solve the kinds of problems we are facing?\n\

Ocean acidification, pollution, sea level rise, habitat loss, extreme weather, overpopulation, co2 buildup, drought, the great pacific plastic garbage gyre. It is a never ending list.\n\

We hear that corporate interests are cutting down the rainforests in the Amazon and Borneo, that monoculture farming is dangerous, that we’re relying on antibiotics too much, that low lying coastal regions are increasingly vulnerable to flood, that large scale refugee migrations may destabilize countries.\n\

We hear about tipping points, that methane hydrates trapped under the oceans may be released as our planet heats up and that we’ll smother to death under a methane sky.\n\

There’s an idea of “the sixth extinction”, that the earth has had many large extinctions previously, and that some were caused by similar kinds of self induced criticalities, and that this may just be another one of them on the geological scale.\n\

The voices of experts - taking Steven Hawking for example - exhort us to look at ways to get off planet - warning us that “it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster on earth in the next 100 years”.\n\

While you and I are hearing one message, other people are hearing a very different message. Some people hear that environmental radicals are blocking important economic projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline, or that needless worries over CO2 emissions are making it hard for businesses to succeed. Either way there is a sense of a hypothetical ‘other’ that we must fight who is also in some ways ourselves.\n\

"\
When you think about what you hear in the media and you think about how wrong headed some peoples views seem to be - how does that make you feel? Is there a sense of frustration, or grief? Is there ambivalence? A sense of worry? Or do you just ignore it?\n\
\n\
What I want to focus on here isn't the actual crisis itself but our response to it. Our response or lack thereof is ultimately all that matters. For whatever reasons there appears to be a a certain kind of emotional reaction being produced. There's a kind of nihilism or melancholia; a sense of futility.\n\
\n\
Our emotions drive our reasoning. We chose to get rational and pragmatic about things that we are passionate about, that we feel empowered to tackle. By looking at how we feel, by creating valid emotional space around our own reactions, we can get clarity on how we choose to act. It is almost as if we need a planetary therapist.\n\
