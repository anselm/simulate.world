Current Responses on the global stage\n\
\n\
There’s no visible consistent or unified international response to the burgeoning crisis. In many cases we’re spending billions of dollars to pay for environmental damages caused by millions of dollars reaped in profit by private corporations.\n\

"\
We can think of our world as made up of stakeholders and their interests. Nature herself, the poor, the middle class, city level government, state and federal concerns. There are transnational corporations and the wealthy elite that ostensibly “own” on paper and with guns the majority of the worlds resources.\n\
\n\
Not all stakeholders need to necessarily participate in all decisions but regional stakeholders seem to be marginalized unduly. Different stakeholders have different goals, some are environmental, economic, political, social, humanist, utilitarian and the like.\n\

  notes:
"\
The current decision making structure seems to be centered around an idea of representational voting in democratic regions, with autocratic dictatorships in other regions. Corporate interests seem to be the main decision making structure planet wide with law and policy steered in that direction (such as NAFTA and TPP). These corporate structures appear to be deeply interwoven into governance in such a way that it can be said that they effectively govern. But at the same time they don’t seem to be acting in an intelligent (or especially unified or responsive) way to ameliorate the environmental concerns.\n\
\n\
In fact the decision making structures we do have seem to be flat out awful. The response to Hurricane Katrina is evidence of this. The same for Haiti where official responses exacerbated the issues rather than helped.\n\

  notes:
"\
At the individual level there’s a wide range of passive responses that won't work:\n\
\n\
1. Waiting for our governments to “do something”.\n\
\n\
2. Hoping for energy alternatives to emerge quickly enough that we can stop using fossil fuels and possibly repair the earth and continue with business as usual.\n\
\n\
3. Hoping for other technology to emerge quickly enough to save the world in some undefined way.\n\
\n\
4. Trying to get off planet before the crisis really hits.\n\
\n\
5. Life-boating; the wealthy are building retreats where they feel safer.\n\
\n\
6. Denialism. Trying to claim nothing is happening and that everything is fine.\n\
\n\
7. Geoengineering is being considered; this may also have dramatic side-effects.\n\
\n\
8. Acting locally such as by not using plastic garbage bags and other kinds of feel-good behavior such as encouraged by http://www.savetheworld.350.com \n\
\n\
9. Hoping for a sudden “planetary awakening” of human consciousness.\n\
\n\
There are “ideas” such as Cybernetics or even the Technocracy Movement (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy_movement ) that were proposed years ago. I don’t see any modern strategy being proposed today. People are still being split on hot button issues that map to their vested interests and are exhibiting avoidant behavior.\n\
\n\
What we’re not seeing is a pragmatic, unified, planet wide push based on rigor, the best science, unified opinions and direct action.\n\

"\
Hacking the system\n\
\n\
It appears that while we have planetary impacts we don’t yet have planetary level organization. We have simply outgrown our decision making structures.\n\
\n\
How do we learn to organize better? I personally feel the answer has to involve local decision making - that we have to find a way to give stewardship back to local stakeholders who are disempowered, mis-informed and checked out.\n\
\n\
It feels like that solutions to the crisis will not come from the same patterns that created the crisis. We’re going to have to hack the system at some level. It’s going to mean structural change rather than procedural change. We’re going to have to build new systems right next to the old systems and start switching over.\n\
\n\
Concepts such as representative democracy or capitalism just don’t seem to map to ideas such as local stewardship, longer term growth and investment in nature. We have to find a way to give all stakeholders (including nature) a voice. We have to find different models of decision making that are bottom up, collaborative, that encourage understanding and participation rather than discourage it.\n\

"\
There isn’t an underlying consistent sense of “how to fix things”. As people most affected by environmental change we are all primary stakeholders. Yet we are in conflict which each other and unable to act in concert.\n\
\n\
Some of us were raised with Thoreau, others with Ayn Rand. There’s a wide range of opinions about what nature is and how we should act. At the end of the day different people react in different ways, depending on their upbringing, their culture, their values.\n\
\n\
Troublingly private interests with more focus are able to pursue their own short term interests. They foster fear, uncertainty and doubt and make short term profits despite the best interests of the majority stakeholders. Long term of course nobody actually wins.\n\
\n\
At some level the Earth will always be fine; it is really just the human race that is at risk of extinction. And it appears that the cause of our extinction is our inability to come to consensus more than anything else. We're acting like deer paralyzed in the headlights of an onrushing car; unable to understand or think fast enough to respond intelligently.\n\

"\
It makes sense that this is hard for us. At heart we are still in some respects just very smart monkeys. Thrown upwards in an evolutionary crescendo. An utterly confounding combination of instinct and godlike apprehension. Capable of great organization and great discord. Just as our world shaped us, we are now shaping it.\n\
\n\
The evidence shows that we are poor decision makers. It’s not necessarily our fault. We’re simply not smart enough (yet) to deal with the complexity of the systems around us. While we can see fast events like literal forest fires, we have trouble seeing slower fires like Pine Beetle Infestations.\n\
\n\
It’s like a 12 step program for civilization where we need to first acknowledge that it is impossible to understand the world, that it is impossible to reason fully about the outcomes of our actions, that the side-effects of our decisions tend to dominate over intended consequences.\n\
\n\
This is a crisis of organization. Spurred by population growth, by our powers over nature, and by our limited ability to reason we now need to evolve new ways to think as communities.\n\
\n\
Yet for better or worse we are the only thing that can save this world and we must find ways to organize to affect our future history. At some level this is probably one of the few jobs that matter. Saving money into a retirement fund seems meaningless in the light of a future that may not even exist.\n\
\n\
The question is can a group of very small very smart monkeys learn to understand a huge planet well enough to protect it? Can we gather and organize our data, our understanding into a decision making structure that lets us both see and act better? Can monkeys organize such that they can avoid a crisis they cannot see, touch, smell, taste or bite? That is contrary to our instincts, contrary to our skills? Will we become a footnote in the fossil record or will we become something new?\n\
