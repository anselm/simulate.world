Objectively speaking we do have (emerging) superpowers

Luckily for us just as we’re starting to have a real impact on the world, we’re also developing surprising powers.

This is remarkably good timing. It could easily have been that humans overpopulated the world before we had technology, or that ideas like “electricity” just weren’t possible, that physics didn’t allow transistors or that environmental tipping points were reached sooner. It is an interesting coincidence that just as we’re starting to wreak global havoc we have the power to also effect global healing.

Some of the powers we’re developing include:

1) We’re entering an age of “civic applications”. Sometimes it feels like the only thing moving as fast as the crisis is the growth of our social networks. We have a new ability to react in concert on a large scale. For example in response to the Haiti earthquakes there was a massive international grassroots community effort to help map streets and remotely direct emergency operations and logistics. We see civic applications like:
Ushahidi - an internet based emergency crisis response tool.
Wikipedia - of course.
“Folding @ Home”
FourSquare
OpenStreetMaps and similar projects like GreenMaps.
Code For America and their work.

2) Earth Sciences has also blossomed. We’re beginning to understand the complexity and subtle interactions among natural forces in ways we did not before. In the 1960’s and 80’s the Army Corp of Engineers engaged in dredging in Louisiana and the Florida wetlands in such a way that put us at risk for what happened with Hurricane Katrina. Now, based on satellite data and better understanding, these kinds of projects are less justifiable. We have a better and more technical understanding of the complexity of these large scale systems and are able to make better decisions.

3) Moores law is acting in our favor. Machine computation, big data and computer simulations are able to simulate large scale outcomes of complex systems. Hybrid human/machine systems that combine human intuition with machine speed and memory are able to search large problem spaces for sweet spots faster than either could do alone. Being able to synthesize the input of many people also creates a possibility that more minds can participate in looking at and understanding the problems we are facing.

4) We have enough history as a planetary civilization to understand our impacts on our world. We’ve seen that side-effects can dominate over intended consequences. And we’ve succeeded on a global scale such as eradicating polio under the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and eradicating chlorofluorocarbons under the Montreal Protocol. We are struggling to unify around reduction of CO2 emissions and several initiatives have failed (such as the Kyoto Protocol) but this too is becoming a visible global agenda item.

These powers together hint at a new kind of organism; a kind of being that has a planetary scale vision, apprehension and decision making ability.
Organizing better; the missing piece?

There is a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt around the emerging crisis. But we are not powerless. Rather, it appears that while we have planetary impacts we don’t yet have planetary level organization. We have simply outgrown our decision making structures.
Hacking the system

How do we learn to organize better? I personally feel the answer has to involve local decision making - that we have to find a way to give stewardship back to local stakeholders who are disempowered, mis-informed and checked out.

It feels like that solutions to the crisis will not come from the same patterns that created the crisis. We’re going to have to hack the system at some level. It’s going to mean structural change rather than procedural change. We’re going to have to build new systems right next to the old systems and start switching over.

Concepts such as representative democracy or capitalism just don’t seem to map to ideas such as local stewardship, longer term growth and investment in nature. We have to find a way to give all stakeholders (including nature) a voice. We have to find different models of decision making that are bottom up, collaborative, that encourage understanding and participation rather than discourage it.
Smart Monkeys

It makes sense that this is hard for us. At heart we are still in some respects just very smart monkeys. Thrown upwards in an evolutionary crescendo. An utterly confounding combination of instinct and godlike apprehension. Capable of great organization and great discord. Just as our world shaped us, we are now shaping it.

Yet for better or worse we are the only thing that can save this world and we must find ways to organize to affect our future history. At some level this is probably one of the few jobs that matter. Saving money into a retirement fund seems meaningless in the light of a future that may not even exist.

The evidence shows that we are poor decision makers. It’s not necessarily our fault. We’re simply not smart enough (yet) to deal with the complexity of the systems around us. While we can see fast events like literal forest fires, we have trouble seeing slower fires like Pine Beetle Infestations. It’s like a 12 step program for civilization where we need to first acknowledge that it is impossible to understand the world, that it is impossible to reason fully about the outcomes of our actions, that the side-effects of our decisions tend to dominate over intended consequences.

This is a crisis of organization. Spurred by population growth, by our powers over nature, and by our limited ability to reason we now need to evolve new ways to think as communities.

The question is can a group of very small very smart monkeys learn to understand a huge planet well enough to protect it? Can we gather and organize our data, our understanding into a decision making structure that lets us both see and act better? Can monkeys organize such that they can avoid a crisis they cannot see, touch, smell, taste or bite? That is contrary to our instincts, contrary to our skills? Will we become a footnote in the fossil record or will we become something new?
