Participate!\n\
\n\
What steps can we take to make this happen?\n\
\n\
Collaborate! Help support the actual development of real world models with real world stakeholders. This includes funding and developers and leveraging the expertise of people who have built these kinds of simulations already.\n\
\n\
Stakeholders. Know your place. Help find people that are facing the kinds of informational challenges that technology like this can help resolve. These people effectively become the seeds of the community and have to be chosen carefully.\n\
\n\
Make. The best approach seems to be to build actual examples that showcase the ideas, to speak on these topics, get feedback and build a community of active participants to move this idea forward.\n\
