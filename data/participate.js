Participate!

What steps can we take to make this happen?

Collaborators. We need to find people who will support the actual development of real world models with real world stakeholders. This includes funding and developers and leveraging the expertise of people who have built these kinds of simulations already.

Stakeholders. We need to find people that are facing the kinds of informational challenges that technology like this can help resolve. These people effectively become the seeds of the community and have to be chosen carefully.

Make. The best approach seems to be to build actual examples that showcase the ideas, to speak on these topics, get feedback and build a community of active participants to move this idea forward.

Information is power. But both private interests and public interests would benefit from more information sharing. Private interests are able to reap short term benefits against other stakeholders because they have access to information the rest of us donâ€™t have. We need to find ways to level that playing field.
