"Case Study: California Drought\n\
\n\
Drought is a misnomer, a better moniker is 'more extreme weather'\n\
\n\
This is a good example of a crisis to model for a number of reasons. The media presents it with a certain tone of hysteria and discord. Water is an intersectional topic that underpins many environmental, social and political issues each with its own stakeholders. Water hydrography in California is well understood; we have enough data to simulate different policies and predict outcomes.\n\
\n\
Solutions are many-fold and difficult to choose between. Desalination? Migration? Better conservation? The crisis is one of organization. Solving California water issues requires large scale social and political mobilization and that in turn requires consensus. Consensus building requires some kind of shared understanding presumably.\n\
\n\
California has a unique water hydrography with highly managed water sources. About a third of our water comes down from snow melt in the High Sierras. It ends up in reservoirs like Hetch Hetchy and from there goes into aqueducts where it is routed between intervening wilderness, hydropower plants, factories, farms and towns. See also:\n\

\n\
A simplified digital model should be able to predict the same outcomes that more detailed government or corporate models show. It should show different stakeholder interests and should let us try out different scenarios.\n\
Statistics and Numbers\n\
\n\
Here are some May 2015 articles, reports and numbers to start off with:\n\
\n\
From Mother Jones: \n\

http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/03/california-pumping-water-fell-earth-20000-years-ago\n\
(It’s worth noting that there are many videos in the above that are worth watching).\n\
The total amount of water [ snow pack, rivers, reservoirs, water in soil, groundwater ] is 34 million acre-feet below normal.\n\
Reserves are going down by 12 million acre-feet per year.\n\
2/3rds of losses are attributed to groundwater pumping in the Central Valley\n\
Agriculture account for  80% of water consumption in California.\n\
Water reserves took 20,000 years to build up - hard to rebuild quickly.\n\
California produces > 90% of all US almonds, walnuts, pistachios, broccoli, strawberries, grapes, tomatoes.\n\
1000 cubic kilometers of water have been depleted from 1998-2000 (enough to contribute to rising sea levels).\n\
As water is pulled up from aquifers land sinks - a foot per year in some regions.\n\
Damage from land subsidence in one area cost 1.3 billion dollars\n\
Water being pumped up can be between 10,000 and 30,000 years old.\n\
When aquifers collapse they cannot necessarily be refilled.\n\
\n\
From The Atlantic\n\

Snowpack is at 12% of normal\n\
Winter temperatures were 4.4 percent warmer than average for 20th century so far\n\
California reservoirs (part of the reserves) have a one year supply left\n\
California soil can yield 60% more spinach per acre per year than other places\n\
California is worlds 5th largest supplier of food\n\
California is worlds 7th largest economy\n\
Irrigation claims 41% of the water supply\n\
Water intensive crops have higher profit margins\n\
Almonds, grown exclusively in California in the United States, consume 600 gallons of water per pound of nuts, more than 25 times the water needed per pound of tomato.\n\
Drought cost California estimated $2.2 billion last year\n\
California agriculture 17,000 farmers lost their jobs in 2014\n\
Governor Jerry Brown announced a $1 billion aid package. $650 million is for flood prevention.\n\
Substantial cross-basin transfers already exist (such as humans moving entire rivers)\n\
Fracking pollutes 2 million gallons of water per day according to 350.org\n\
http://350.org/press-release/350-responds-to-gov-browns-water-crisis-announcement\n\
Each fracked well uses 166000 gallons of water per day\n\

http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/08/140819-groundwater-california-drought-aquifers-hidden-crisis/ - As drought worsens groundwater depletion, water supplies for people and farming shrink, and this scarcity can set the table for social unrest. Saudi Arabia, which a few decades ago began pumping deep underground aquifers to grow wheat in the desert, has since abandoned the plan, in order to conserve what groundwater supplies remain, relying instead on imported wheat to feed the people of this arid land.\n\

' Culverts sluiced latte-colored sediment into the river from the road and the logging operations it served. The muck clouded long stretches of spawning grounds for the federally threatened coho salmon, possibly smothering fish eggs, scraping adults' gills, and interrupting feeding.\n\
