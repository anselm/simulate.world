"Case Study: California Drought\n\
\n\
Drought is a misnomer - more extreme weather is more correct\n\
\n\
This is a good example of a crisis to model for a number of reasons. The media presents it with a certain tone of hysteria and discord. Water is an intersectional topic that underpins many environmental, social and political issues each with its own stakeholders. Water hydrography in California is well understood; we have enough data to simulate different policies and predict outcomes.\n\
\n\
Solutions are many-fold and difficult to choose between. Desalination? Migration? Better conservation? The crisis is one of organization. Solving California water issues requires large scale social and political mobilization and that in turn requires consensus. Consensus building requires some kind of shared understanding presumably.\n\
\n\
California has a unique water hydrography with highly managed water sources. About a third of our water comes down from snow melt in the High Sierras. It ends up in reservoirs like Hetch Hetchy and from there goes into aqueducts where it is routed between intervening wilderness, hydropower plants, factories, farms and towns. See also:\n\

\n\
A simplified digital model should be able to predict the same outcomes that more detailed government or corporate models show. It should show different stakeholder interests and should let us try out different scenarios.\n\
Statistics and Numbers\n\
\n\
Here are some May 2015 articles, reports and numbers to start off with:\n\
\n\
From Mother Jones: \n\

http://www.feelguide.com/2015/03/22/r-i-p-california-1850-2016-what-well-lose-and-learn-from-the-worlds-first-major-water-collapse/\n\
http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/03/california-pumping-water-fell-earth-20000-years-ago\n\
(It’s worth noting that there are many videos in the above that are worth watching).\n\
The total amount of water [ snow pack, rivers, reservoirs, water in soil, groundwater ] is 34 million acre-feet below normal.\n\
Reserves are going down by 12 million acre-feet per year.\n\
2/3rds of losses are attributed to groundwater pumping in the Central Valley\n\
Agriculture account for  80% of water consumption in California.\n\
Water reserves took 20,000 years to build up - hard to rebuild quickly.\n\
California produces > 90% of all US almonds, walnuts, pistachios, broccoli, strawberries, grapes, tomatoes.\n\
1000 cubic kilometers of water have been depleted from 1998-2000 (enough to contribute to rising sea levels).\n\
As water is pulled up from aquifers land sinks - a foot per year in some regions.\n\
Damage from land subsidence in one area cost 1.3 billion dollars\n\
Water being pumped up can be between 10,000 and 30,000 years old.\n\
When aquifers collapse they cannot necessarily be refilled.\n\
\n\
From The Atlantic\n\
\n\
http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/03/the-economics-of-californias-drought/388375/\n\
Snowpack is at 12% of normal\n\
Winter temperatures were 4.4 percent warmer than average for 20th century so far\n\
California reservoirs (part of the reserves) have a one year supply left\n\
California soil can yield 60% more spinach per acre per year than other places\n\
California is worlds 5th largest supplier of food\n\
California is worlds 7th largest economy\n\
Irrigation claims 41% of the water supply\n\
Water intensive crops have higher profit margins\n\
Almonds, grown exclusively in California in the United States, consume 600 gallons of water per pound of nuts, more than 25 times the water needed per pound of tomato.\n\
Drought cost California estimated $2.2 billion last year\n\
California agriculture 17,000 farmers lost their jobs in 2014\n\
Governor Jerry Brown announced a $1 billion aid package. $650 million is for flood prevention.\n\
Substantial cross-basin transfers already exist (such as humans moving entire rivers)\n\
Fracking pollutes 2 million gallons of water per day according to 350.org\n\
http://350.org/press-release/350-responds-to-gov-browns-water-crisis-announcement\n\
Each fracked well uses 166000 gallons of water per day\n\

http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/08/140819-groundwater-california-drought-aquifers-hidden-crisis/ - As drought worsens groundwater depletion, water supplies for people and farming shrink, and this scarcity can set the table for social unrest. Saudi Arabia, which a few decades ago began pumping deep underground aquifers to grow wheat in the desert, has since abandoned the plan, in order to conserve what groundwater supplies remain, relying instead on imported wheat to feed the people of this arid land.\n\

' Culverts sluiced latte-colored sediment into the river from the road and the logging operations it served. The muck clouded long stretches of spawning grounds for the federally threatened coho salmon, possibly smothering fish eggs, scraping adults' gills, and interrupting feeding.\n\

\n\
Modeling\n\
\n\
Given the kinds of subjects and issues above - how can we approximate a model of this system? \n\
\n\
We need some kind of database { towns, people, power generation, power consumption, rivers, aqueducts, pumping stations, power plants, irrigation, central valley farms, lifts, canals, dams, pipelines, tunnels, estuaries }\n\
This would be an encyclopedia of objects similar to some of the semantic databases that were popular and similar to wikipedia; this by itself may be a significant effort. This could be similar to http://wikidata.org or http://freebase.org or http://wolframalpha.com . Historically there were concepts such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore and http://www.w3.org/wiki/LargeTripleStores and http://openrdf.org . I think in my case I need some kind of enumeration of kinds of things I care about, possibly categorized. Many may have geographic boundaries. We could link to wikipedia entries and perhaps include a geometrical shape as well. Donner Lake for example has all of the above including http://www.geonames.org/5343622/donner-lake.html . So we could extract that information into our own model. Or can we find a dataset of this? I suppose I could use the http://nhd.usgs.gov/ which has the network of all of the connected water. And maybe http://nhd.usgs.gov/gnis.html for names if needed. It would be nice to connect that to Wikipedia. http://www.naturalearthdata.com also. Open Street Maps also has this. And geonames.nga.mil as well.\n\

http://www.horizon-systems.com/nhdplus/ \n\
It probably helps to have roads and elevation data too.\n\
\n\
Approach Test #1\n\
\n\
A vector model based approach; where users would wire together objects (as opposed to a brute force cellular automata) for now. Does lack some flexibility to do fine grained simulations but could be good enough to communicate and test ideas.\n\
Running in the cloud on a service like parse.com - which implies that all vector features are stored in the cloud and that a client side javascript engine is fetching and rendering and computing entire worlds forward in time (also inefficient and won’t really scale but again will give users a cartoon like sense of interaction with the simulation). This also helps with other ideas like encouraging a cut/remix culture. This pattern makes it easier for me to implement an implicit idea where each user can have their own login accounts, and can run their own simulations and copy and see others work.\n\
Typical features can be stored in the cloud and indeed described in the cloud prior to having a fancy UI. Typical features would be things like rivers, fish, buildings, people, dams, cities and the like. Ideally they could be wired together in some way. Feature data such as polygon boundaries for countries could be scraped from servers later.\n\
I would be conflating concepts such as simulation and visualization together.\n\
I may have a little prince world rather than the real earth for initial tests because this gives a concept of closure better.\n\
Threejs is the obvious rendering solution. Famo.us can be used as well.\n\
I’d like to be able to have an editable page per item - or at least a card per item.\n\
All of this has to be light and social on some kind of social web page “everyworld” etc. Like a wiki or something that allows multiple contributors; github? or something?\n\
\n\
Todo #1\n\
\n\
i made it so that the visualization handles cloning, picking, moving\n\
make it also handle splines and resizing manipulators by itself\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
(minor) pull the palette out so it is not zbuffered in at least\n\
can i fetch a shapefile for california and render it - ideally entirely in js?\n\
can i have a planar mode as opposed to a circular mode\n\
\n\
lakes - use a sphere, can be stretched with handles, has an info button\n\
when you rollover hover we will show manipulators that stay alive for a while\n\
i think four of them are good on cardinal axes\n\
i’d like to let you drag them outwards parallel to the plane of the center\n\
i’d like to let you rotate them also; basically we’re constraining the motion to the plane\n\
we have to paint them so they are pointing outwards from the center\n\
you can still also grab the object itself and move it\n\
\n\
river - have grabbers for each end; i guess a river is n nodes\n\
we drop in three objects i guess - and you grab and move the center\n\
the end points are going to be manipulators\n\
we need to be able to insert manipulators also; bsplines etc; if we are wiring things up.\n\
\n\
a city that can be placed and stretched (to estimate water+elec+oil+food)\n\
a farm that has water as an input and emits food\n\
\n\
later\n\
a solar object\n\
a wind object\n\
a nuclear object\n\
coal? how much coal do we actually use?\n\
fracking? oil?\n\
an electric wire that can attach to a city\n\
dam\n\
salmon\n\
bear\n\
forest / nature / baobob trees? as a standin?\n\
\n\
let you somehow wire them together\n\
\n\
let you play the simulation forward in time, pause or rewind etc\n\
\n\
it might be nice to be able to have intervention points to change values in time\n\
\n\
diameter of rivers and the like should change with time\n\
cities should turn red or brown if they don’t get enough water\n\
show statistics also\n\
\n\
#2\n\
\n\
show statistics and win lose conditions\n\
actually mount it on parse and actually have login accounts with cut and paste etc\n\
\n\
#3\n\
ground deformation perhaps by placing ideal elevation markers or just tugging\n\
put water in the ground so it looks better by leveling the ground\n\
maybe computationally simulate how water goes from snowpack to alpine streams\n\
