"\n\
I'm interested in tools that help people make decisions better. Right now lots of corporations and governments have digital models of the predicted impacts of their decisions. Their planners are able to strategically look into the future to make the best decisions as the sum of all of their knowledge.\n\
\n\
But what we don't have is any kind of 'civic' digital model. As citizens we read summaries about what scientists or planners think but we never get to play with the models ourselves. We are not given an ability to participate in the decisions that affect us as stakeholders in the region. At best we get to vote based on the opinion supplied by experts.\n\
\n\
I want to provide people and communities with tools that allow them to simulate and predict the impact of new laws and policy on their regional social, economic and environmental landscape. The goal is to provide new tools for local decision making.\n\
\n\
If you’ve played SimCity then you're familiar with the idea of digital simulations and models. Basically you take a small toy world, a stripped down and simplified version of the real world and start asking 'what if?'. And it turns out that this is good enough to often answer many questions, or at least reject some of the worst ideas.\n\
\n\
Weekly weather reports are also a good example. At first we had Farmer's Almanacs that had a historical record of weather patterns. Now we have supercomputers that can do near term predictions with some accuracy - and we've come to rely on these models to make better decisions.\n\
\n\
It is also a common theme touched upon by many such as Buckminister Fuller with 'The World Game' or Mark Pesce in 'The Playful World' as well as by many others.\n\
\n\
In this case I want to build models with real policy, real data, and simulate the watersheds and ecosystems forwards in time in order to let people anticipate local events (even coarsely) on a broad scale rather than just react to them.\n\
\n\
Simulating the effects of land-use laws, existing and proposed civic policy, natural phenomena and any other factors that contribute to regional outcomes is challenging. But it’s important to provide new tools for communities. The kinds of subjects that may be a part of the simulation include zoning laws for greywater collection, land use law, seasonal rainfall, the behavior of river systems, fishing, hydroelectric, farming, farming run-off, aquifer usage, dollar incomes, oil consumption and c02 production. Participants should be able to extend the model and add more subjects as well.\n\
\n\
These simulations should be open, public and free. Anybody should be able to contribute facts or relationships to the models. Anybody should be able to use or modify the models as they wish.\n\
\n\
There will be many kinds of models, many kinds of simulations, written by different people. There’s no desire to write a single “solution”. But will be an effort to share data. At the end of the day these will be civic resources: kind of like a real world version of SimCity. The hope will be that a community can use this to see itself better, enfranchise participation by the regional stakeholders and teach people about the complexity of local ecosystems.\n\
\n\
It's worth noting that the goal isn't to actually 'solve problems' directly. If a community ratifies the cutting down of their own forests - so be it. The goal is to just empower people to make more complicated decisions together more effectively. At some level we have to let the regional stakeholders make their own decisions.  A computer simulation can test the outcome of proposed policies and can score the whole system by a number of factors such as economic benefit and environmental costs. More importantly unexpected side-effects can be discovered and examined. It becomes harder for parasites to subvert the system by hiding information. \n\
\n\
Why?\n\
\n\
We face serious social, environmental and economic challenges. Yet we don’t seem to have the tools for civic engagement. It seems extremely difficult to create effective change. It feels almost as if none of the participants are happy with the status quo but nobody is able to create change. The system has ground down on it’s own bureaucracy and it feels hopelessly outdated and baroque. Do you feel involved in your community? Do you feel you have a voice? Do you feel that you can make any change? Do you feel everything is running well?\n\
\n\
Imagine an ordinary individual being able to present a case to city council for a watershed protection plan that included an actual simulation of that watershed and that could show both the intrinsic benefits of protecting the ecosystem and show how financial costs and rewards balance out.\n\
\n\
Imagine being able to have a simulation of an entire town that could computationally project the outcome of specific policy changes such laws regarding wildlife hunting permits, daylighting streams, farmland pesticide use and the like. New laws that had unforeseen side-effects might become more visible. Effectively this becomes a form of participatory budgeting, and offers a possibility of an enlightened civic debate.\n\
\n\
Imagine simply being able to zoom into your bioregion and see the hidden systems at work, the input and outputs that define your community. Imagine being able to explore the future projected behavior of the system based on known relationships. Imagine being able to play with parameters, try out new relationships, or change assumptions and test outcomes.\n\

Benefits\n\
\n\
Some of the kinds of benefits it could provide include:\n\
\n\
<b>Engagement and learning</b>. I see open digital models of communities as tools for citizen engagement in local politics. Tools that let people try out their own ideas have an effect of both educating and engaging citizens in effective ways. Citizen science tends to be deprecated in favor of paid expertise; this may sway the balance back towards open participation.\n\
\n\
<b>Level the playing field</b>. I also see this as a way to level the playing field between private interests and the public. All too often private ventures are able to organize more effectively and pursue goals that are not always necessarily in the public interest. If ordinary citizens could have access to similar data and a similar understanding of regional issues they may be able to suggest alternatives.\n\
\n\
<b>More minds at the table</b>. Right now most people are checked out of civic politics. They don’t participate in city council and it often feels like it is too much work to get involved. But more minds can provide more solutions. Our systems could benefit from more insight if there is an effective way to coordinate participation.\n\
\n\
<b>Memory storehouse</b>. There’s so much local civic understanding that is in just a few peoples heads. The relationship between various pieces of land and the best uses for that land. The way things used to be, or the way things could be. A model acts like a kind of local wikipedia, it stores community knowledge in a way that is useful.\n\
\n\
<b>Aligning voices</b>. Any proposition to include more people in local decision making has to also dampen the typical noise and furor of discussion. Decision by committee can be ineffective because it is hard to hear everybody and everybody has strongly divergent opinions. The benefit of a model is that although participants can explore arbitrary ideas - the system itself simulates the outcomes and imposes rigor. Effectively discourse shifts from head to head rhetoric to instead testing the merits of various models. Effectively it is like introducing a ball into a game, or a set of pieces. The discussion focuses around a target rather than at each other.\n\
\n\
<b>More decisions more often and more directly</b>. In a representative democracy there’s substantial complexity around decision making. We tend to have a lot of formalisms to protect against voter fraud or intimidation, and there’s quite a bit of effort to convince stakeholders to vote a certain way. In a direct participation model voting could be more frequent and decisions could be easier to evaluate given that multiple models can be scored and tested and compared to each other. Bottom line scoring for the greatest social, environmental and economic benefits is implicit in the model rather than being up for debate. This means that more decisions can be made more often and civic policy can hew more closely to changing environmental conditions more quickly.\n\
\n\
<b>Complexity reduction</b>. The world is actually too complicated to understand with our unaided senses. Side-effects often dominate. There is an information horizon which approaches us faster than our ability to process. Various stakeholders practice asymmetrical information warfare against each other to reap short term benefits at the expense of everybody else. The combination of human-machine hybrid reasoning helps us deal with larger problems. Machines provide brute force search power to explore large problem spaces and humans provide intuition to better find sweet spots in those large spaces.\n\
\n\
<b>Anticipatory Democracy and Durable Communities</b>. A simulations based approach can provide a fresh alternative to traditional governance. At the end of the day the goal is to build intelligent durable communities that thrive and that in fact can anticipate from and benefit from change rather than merely react or merely sustain their own existence. There’s a possibility that these kinds of communities could make their local ecosystems much richer, much more diverse and more resilient to the inevitable black swan events that occur in our world. Most importantly it can enfranchise the real stakeholders, blocking parasitical private interests, and shift wealth production to being invested into local ecosystems rather than being extracted.\n\

\n\
Data\n\
\n\
Water Data. Water is such a critical component of an ecosystem model that it will show up in many of the examples as a core topic. It may need to be modeled especially accurately. The water cycle is complex. Aquifers for example may collapse once exhausted. And in some regions water shortages don’t start to take place until years into a drought due to the hydraulic nature of water reserves. Seasonal variations in water discharge into streams depend on snow melt the year before and a variety of other wind and weather conditions. Farms and urban centers use water at varying rates and in varying ways depending on assigned water rights. The migrations of fish up-river depend on many water factors; not just dams or fish ladders but also turbidity, temperature, salinity, log overhangs just to name a few.\n\
\n\
Relationships. Unfortunately the relationships between data points is not documented as well as the data itself. There are seasonal datasets that show how complex systems behave over time but these just log historical events. It may be possible to derive relationships from these facts but that is still work that needs to be done.\n\
\n\
Multiple data sources. Substantial data already exists describing hydrography, animal habitat, farming conditions, water rights and the like. Collecting available local facts, figures and relationships that describe the behavior of local watersheds, bioregions, the effects of law and policy on those regions and people is critical. This will be akin to an Open Street Maps or Ordnance Survey. In the United States the Census Bureau and the United States Geological Survey provide data including roads, human populations, the National Hydrography Dataset and the Watershed Boundary Dataset. There are many other data sources as well.\n\
\n\
Historical data. Simulations need to be trained against historical data. In the initial stages the goal isn’t necessarily accuracy however: it is to act as a way to cut away at the most egregious rhetoric, and as a teaching tool about the complexity of natural systems, the value of thinking in terms of whole systems, and the risks of unexpected side-effects.\n\
\n\
Data resolution. Farms have certain production rates of certain kinds of crops. They also have certain inputs in terms of water and other resources. Energy generation such as hydroelectric, solar, coal each have initial costs and ongoing costs as well as yields. Urban centers consume resources at a certain rate - below that rate chaos ensues or populations begin to migrate or have diminished productivity. There will be many kinds of models at varying resolutions, with many kinds of data. All farms in a given model may only produce one output; or in other cases (such as modeling California Drought) it may be broken down into specific kinds of crops (such as grains, avocado and almonds).\n\
\n\
Curated. People need to be able to take observed facts and relationships about a region and pour them into some kind of shared open database. This database needs to be similar to wikipedia in that it has to be open yet probably curated to avoid spam.\n\
\n\
Pre-populated. The models should allow stakeholders to populate a scenario with their own data. However, as well, seeding the system with provided data helps novices participate more easily.\n\
\n\
User Interface\n\
\n\
Simple. The user interfaces need to approach people at their own level. That means cartoonifying the data where needed if it is too complex for a certain audience. Different implementations of the simulations will probably address different audiences.\n\
\n\
Simulate outcomes. People should be able to simulate forward in time the interaction of the facts and relationships to computationally simulate outcomes. This implies some kind of computational infrastructure. In an ideal world it would be distributed and run on individuals machines rather than on servers (in order to be more civic).\n\
\n\
Multiple simulations. It likely will be many simulations written by many different people. It is unlikely that any single solution would dominate. Just as there are many applications for word-processing there are likely going to be many applications for modeling communities.\n\
\n\
Varying accuracy. Accuracy of the simulations and models doesn’t have to be precise in initial implementations. The goal is mostly providing a framework for people to test their observations and ideas. The shift in thinking is to allow stakeholders to speculate about the inputs, but not allow them to speculate about the effects or outputs. That already is a significant shift.\n\
