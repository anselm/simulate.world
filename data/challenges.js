One of the topics I’m curious about is to build some kind of simple predictive model of the “big picture”.\
\
Global Warming as a result of human population growth and fossil fuel consumption is probably the most significant event happening on the planet today.\

\
\
 One of the main effects of human population growth is Global Warming. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel consumption and other human actions (such as deforestation and cement production) is altering the composition of the atmosphere and possibly a primary cause of global warming. About 80% of our energy comes from fossil fuel consumption (according to Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption ). About 79 million tons of CO2 is released into the atmosphere every day. CO2 is a “greenhouse gas” that helps retain the energy from sunlight as it strikes the Earth. It is naturally occurring and is one of the reasons the Earth is habitable today. Concentrations of CO2 however have increased and there is a correlation between CO2 levels and temperature rise as shown in historical record. This is one of the primary topics that Al Gore has been focusing on with his work on “An Inconvenient Truth” and is of grave concern to any of us who happen to live on this planet. The knock-on effects just from global warming include:\
\
1. <b>Ocean heat absorption.</b> The oceans may be moderating the warming trends overall by absorbing heat from the greenhouse effects. Since they have a vast thermal capacity they can store energy without it affecting us as “directly”.\
Ocean acidification. CO2 in the atmosphere reacts with water to produce a weak acid H2CO3 (carbonic acid). This then dissociates into hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions. The hydrogen ions increase ocean acidity. The average pH of today’s surface waters is about 8.1 - an increase of 0.1 pH over the last 200 years.\
2. <b>Coral Reef Death.</b> Organisms that make calcium carbonate shells such as coral reefs, snails and sea urchins are affected directly by both water warming and ocean acidification. Overfishing, pollution and development also have a negative impact on reefs. Tropical coral reefs are the foundation of marine biodiversity, providing shelter and habitat for many other species. As well coral reefs provide economic benefits to fishermen and of course are beautiful in their own right. They will likely be extinct by the year 2100 and those entire ecosystems will collapse accordingly according to some reports. About 20 percent of reefs have died in the last few decades already. A single bleaching event that lasted a few weeks in the reefs of Seychelles in the Indian Ocean was responsible for the death of 16 percent of the worlds coral. \
3. <b>Hurricane ferocity.</b> One ingredient for hurricanes is warm water. Usually surface water temperatures need to be over 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit) for a hurricane to form. Science seems to support the notion that warmer temperatures caused by global warming may contribute to more intense hurricanes. Hurricanes can cause substantial damage, especially combined with other environmental issues such as cutting of mangrove forests such as Hurricane Katrina demonstrated in New Orleans.\
4. <b>Forced plant and animal migrations.</b> As temperatures increase plants and animals reproduce at increasingly extreme latitudes. In some cases due to geography they have no options and simply go extinct. Agricultural pests also migrate towards the poles as ideal habitats change. These changes affect us as well. For example the Mountain Pine Beetle infestation in Canada helped lower cost of lumber in the United States and this in turn led to the housing boom, and the resultant subprime mortgage lending crisis.\
5. <b>Sea level rise.</b> Glacial melting at the poles is leading to sea level rise. Since most human communities are at shorelines, sea level rise impacts can be exacerbated.\
\
If we focus on direct impacts of global warming we see that the Oceans are carrying the brunt of this. This is concerning especially because our seas also carry other human impacts.\

Other human impacts\
\
Aside from fossil fuel consumption humans also have other impacts on the planet at a large scale:\
\
Ocean Fish Overconsumption. According to some reports we may be the last generation to eat fish from the ocean. Salt-water fish may be extinct by 2048 based on overfishing, pollution, habitat loss and climate change.\
Fertilizers, neonicotinoids and other growth inhibitors designed as part of a green revolution philosophy to feed more people by inhibiting pests. These may be affecting human populations, bees and other systems. Honeybee Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is not fully understood. There is some sense we may be able to get on top of this, but it’s a good example of the kind of impacts we can have rapidly before the science catches up. DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) is an insecticide which we did ban because of its impact on bird shell thickness which was putting wild bird populations at risk. Bald Eagles for example fed on insects which had consumed DDT spread by farmers and the claim was that this was affecting their shells.\
Ocean pollution. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Gyre is an example of human pollution where there are exceptionally high concentrations of plastics, waste production sludge and other debris trapped in ocean convection currents. It consists of a small increase in suspended often microscopic particles in the upper water column [wikipedia]. Fish, marine birds and animals consume marine debris and choke to death. Twenty tons of plastic debris washes up on Midway every year with five tons of that debris being fed to Albatross chicks [wikipedia].\
Land pollution… ( such as mountaintop removal, fracking and stream pollution).\
Aquifer exhaustion… (such as is happening in California).\
Invasive species… (such as happens worldwide).\
Diversity Loss through habitat fragmentation, pollution and industrial farming practices. Disappearance of birds, frogs, fish and megafauna and their replacement with corn and other monoculture crops.\
\
Diversity loss is one of those topics that is hard to quantify. Often it isn’t just any one thing but a combination of things that cause extinction events. Biodiversity is a key measure of resilience that defends against “black swan events”. Events of a magnitude that we cannot appreciate or understand them ahead of time. The best way to deal with these kinds of events is to have diverse resources such that at least some of us survive. It’s also similar to playing a giant game of Jenga with the environment. Loss of a key species can have surprising and unexpected effects as other species they rely on die off. For example there is concern around bees and Colony Collapse Disorder since bees are key pollinators for a significant portion of food crops.\

\
Runaway effects\
\
Beyond even this some of these issues have a potential to create runaway effects that are beyond our ability to understand, plan for, or appreciate.\
\
It’s unclear the degree to which these effects will take place and the degree to which we will be able to mitigate them at various possible intervention points. The Methane Hydrates issue is one example - some people believe this could lead to a planetary extinction event - and there is evidence for this having happened before in the fossil record.\
\
Predicted global outcomes\
\
The “probable” outcome of a digital model based on what we’re hearing in the media would appear to be something like this:\
\
Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt continues to be manufactured by corporate and private interests over any outcomes that clash with the status quo or “business as usual”. Motives continue to be greenwashed and everything continues as is.\
Collective decision making by real stakeholders continues to be ineffective.\
An increasingly rapid degradation of quality of life occurs.\
In the next 20~30 years we begin to hit “turning point” decisions. We choose to abandon entire cities, we choose to let people die, we begin “circling the wagons”.\
Food security issues lead to a loss of confidence in governments. Incendiary civil war under social and political or religious pretexts expands. Intentional eco terrorism is used to starve opponents of resources. Full scale war even nuclear war occurs.\
Easily obtained natural resources are exhausted.\
Mega-extinction events begin to occur starting with sea-life.\
Humans are forced to retreat to the poles.\
A few wealthy humans are able to life-boat; leaving the planet.\
A massive reduction in quality of life for the remaining.\
Insufficient intellectual capital and natural resources left to try “grand solutions”.\
\
Basically there is no happy ending.\
Current Responses on the global stage\
\
There’s no visible consistent or unified international response to the burgeoning crisis. In many cases we’re spending billions of dollars to pay for environmental damages caused by millions of dollars reaped in profit by private corporations.\
\
In our current systems of governance we have a number of stakeholders. Nature herself, the poor, the middle class, city level government, state and federal concerns. There are transnational corporations and the wealthy elite that ostensibly “own” on paper and with guns the majority of the worlds resources. Not all stakeholders need to necessarily participate but regional stakeholders seem to be marginalized unduly. Different stakeholders have different goals, some are environmental, economic, political, social, humanist, utilitarian and the like.\
\
The current decision making structure seems to be centered around an idea of representational voting in democratic regions, with autocratic dictatorships in other regions. Corporate interests seem to be the main decision making structure planet wide with law and policy steered in that direction (such as NAFTA and TPP). These corporate structures appear to be deeply interwoven into governance in such a way that it can be said that they effectively govern. But at the same time they don’t seem to be acting in an intelligent (or especially unified or responsive) way to ameliorate the environmental concerns.\
\
In fact the decision making structures we do have seem to be flat out awful. The response to Hurricane Katrina is evidence of this. The same for Haiti where official responses exacerbated the issues rather than helped.\
\
At the individual level there’s a wide range of passive responses:\
\
Waiting for our governments to “do something”.\
Hoping for energy alternatives to emerge quickly enough that we can stop using fossil fuels and possibly repair the earth and continue with business as usual.\
Hoing for other technology to emerge quickly enough to save the world in some undefined way.\
Trying to get off planet before the crisis really hits.\
Life-boating; the wealthy are building retreats where they feel safer.\
Denialism. Trying to claim nothing is happening and that everything is fine.\
Geoengineering is being considered; this may also have dramatic side-effects.\
Acting locally such as by not using plastic garbage bags and other kinds of feel-good behavior such as encouraged by http://www.savetheworld.350.com \
Hoping for a sudden “planetary awakening” of human consciousness.\
\
There are “ideas” such as Cybernetics or even the Technocracy Movement (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy_movement ) that were proposed years ago. I don’t see any modern strategy being proposed today. People are still being split on hot button issues that map to their vested interests and are exhibiting avoidant behavior.\
\
What we’re not seeing is a pragmatic, unified, planet wide push based on rigor, the best science, unified opinions and direct action.\
