The reality of our impacts are more nuanced than can be described cogently using text. It's true that we are a predominant force on this planet. And it is true that our impacts are significant enough that they are becoming a part of the geological record. However we're not entirely a negative influence.\n\
\n\
Reality as they say is 'complicated'. We can begin to approach an understanding by discussing the biggest topics, but small systems also have big impacts. Ultimately we'll need to bring new kinds of tools to bear on seeing our way through this issue clearly.\n\

At the core of human impacts on earth is human population growth. As our populations grow we have more and more impact, consuming resources faster and rewriting landscapes to better fit our desires.\n\
\n\
In 1798 Robert Malthus wrote 'An Essay on the Principle of Population'. In the Malthusian model of human resource consumption human populations grow and eventually consume all resources and then crash. The same principle can be seen in a petri dish with bacteria or in many other settings and it is a common natural phenomena. The Malthusian model however doesn't account for human ingenuity. With green revolution technology we've been able to shift the curve.\n\
\n\
What would it take to build a more accurate model? What are the key facts and issues that would better predict realistic outcomes? What kind of predictive power would such a model have? What would be the trust that people would have in such a model?\n\

"\
One of the main effects of human population growth is Global Warming. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel consumption and other human actions (such as deforestation and cement production) is altering the composition of the atmosphere and is a primary cause of global warming.\n\
\n\
About 80% of our energy comes from fossil fuel consumption (according to Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption ). About 79 million tons of CO2 is released into the atmosphere every day. CO2 is a “greenhouse gas” that helps retain the energy from sunlight as it strikes the Earth. It is naturally occurring and is one of the reasons the Earth is habitable today.\n\
\n\
Concentrations of CO2 however have increased and there is a correlation between CO2 levels and temperature rise as shown in historical record. This is one of the primary topics that Al Gore has been focusing on with his work on “An Inconvenient Truth” and is of grave concern to any of us who happen to live on this planet. The knock-on effects just from global warming include:\n\
\n\
1. <b>Ocean heat absorption.</b> The oceans may be moderating the warming trends overall by absorbing heat from the greenhouse effects. Since they have a vast thermal capacity they can store energy without it affecting us as “directly”.\n\
Ocean acidification. CO2 in the atmosphere reacts with water to produce a weak acid H2CO3 (carbonic acid). This then dissociates into hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions. The hydrogen ions increase ocean acidity. The average pH of today’s surface waters is about 8.1 - an increase of 0.1 pH over the last 200 years.\n\
2. <b>Coral Reef Death.</b> Organisms that make calcium carbonate shells such as coral reefs, snails and sea urchins are affected directly by both water warming and ocean acidification. Overfishing, pollution and development also have a negative impact on reefs. Tropical coral reefs are the foundation of marine biodiversity, providing shelter and habitat for many other species. As well coral reefs provide economic benefits to fishermen and of course are beautiful in their own right. They will likely be extinct by the year 2100 and those entire ecosystems will collapse accordingly according to some reports. About 20 percent of reefs have died in the last few decades already. A single bleaching event that lasted a few weeks in the reefs of Seychelles in the Indian Ocean was responsible for the death of 16 percent of the worlds coral. \n\
3. <b>Hurricane ferocity.</b> One ingredient for hurricanes is warm water. Usually surface water temperatures need to be over 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit) for a hurricane to form. Science seems to support the notion that warmer temperatures caused by global warming may contribute to more intense hurricanes. Hurricanes can cause substantial damage, especially combined with other environmental issues such as cutting of mangrove forests such as Hurricane Katrina demonstrated in New Orleans.\n\
4. <b>Forced plant and animal migrations.</b> As temperatures increase plants and animals reproduce at increasingly extreme latitudes. In some cases due to geography they have no options and simply go extinct. Agricultural pests also migrate towards the poles as ideal habitats change. These changes affect us as well. For example the Mountain Pine Beetle infestation in Canada helped lower cost of lumber in the United States and this in turn led to the housing boom, and the resultant subprime mortgage lending crisis.\n\
5. <b>Sea level rise.</b> Glacial melting at the poles is leading to sea level rise. Since most human communities are at shorelines, sea level rise impacts can be exacerbated.\n\
\n\
Our planets oceans are carrying the brunt of this and to some degree are 'buffering' the impact such that we don't see the repercussions as quickly. It is also worth noting that the oceans also carry a number of other human impacts - in a sense they are allowing us to run our accounts negative and hide our debts for a while.\n\

"\
Aside from fossil fuel consumption humans also have other impacts on the planet at a large scale:\n\
\n\
1. <b>Ocean Fish Overconsumption.</b> According to some reports we may be the last generation to eat fish from the ocean. Salt-water fish may be extinct by 2048 based on overfishing, pollution, habitat loss and climate change.\n\
\n\
2. <b>Fertilizers, neonicotinoids and other growth inhibitors</b> designed as part of a green revolution philosophy to feed more people by inhibiting pests. These may be affecting human populations, bees and other systems.\n\
\n\
3. <b>Honeybee Colony Collapse Disorder</b>. Although not as large an impact as some issues it represents a 'kind' of impact that is not fully understood and which by itself could end our way of life. On a similar note DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) is an insecticide which we did ban because of its impact on bird shell thickness which was putting wild bird populations at risk. Bald Eagles for example fed on insects which had consumed DDT spread by farmers and the claim was that this was affecting their shells. The hope is that we can get on top of this one quickly before we are unable to pollinate our crops.\n\
\n\
4. <b>Ocean pollution.</b> Although long chain polymers such as plastic tend to be fairly inert there are unknown risks here as well. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Gyre is an example of human pollution where there are exceptionally high concentrations of plastics, waste production sludge and other debris trapped in ocean convection currents. It consists of a small increase in suspended often microscopic particles in the upper water column [wikipedia]. Fish, marine birds and animals consume marine debris and choke to death. Twenty tons of plastic debris washes up on Midway every year with five tons of that debris being fed to Albatross chicks [wikipedia].\n\
\n\
5. <b>Pollution</b>. There's a wide range of other kinds of pollution on land, not just landfill or CO2 production but phenomena such as mountaintop removal, fracking and stream pollution. Together these have significant impacts on wildlife populations.\n\
\n\
6. <b>Aquifer exhaustion</b>. Farming communities have a hydraulic dependency on water reserves. Typically aquifers are used in times of drought but once an aquifer is drained it can collapse and cannot be refilled. And we've been utilizing water resources close to maximum thresholds such that aquifers are always needed.\n\
\n\
7. <b>Invasive species</b>.\n\
\n\
8. <b>Diversity Loss</b> through habitat fragmentation, pollution and industrial farming practices. Disappearance of birds, frogs, fish and megafauna and their replacement with corn and other monoculture crops. Often it isn’t just any one thing but a combination of things that cause extinction events. Biodiversity is a key measure of resilience that defends against “black swan events”. Events of a magnitude that we cannot appreciate or understand them ahead of time. The best way to deal with these kinds of events is to have diverse resources such that at least some of us survive. It’s also similar to playing a giant game of Jenga with the environment. Loss of a key species can have surprising and unexpected effects as other species they rely on die off.\n\

It’s worth noting that not all influences are negative. Jesse Ausubel makes the case for a number of rebound effects happening due to changes in human behavior. For example he points out that there is more green cover now than there has been historically and that humans have dramatically improved crop yields over increasingly smaller regions of soil. \n\
