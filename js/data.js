  notes: 
`At the core of human impacts on earth is human population growth. As our populations grow we consume more natural resources at an ever increasing rate. Modernization and the pursuit of “western” lifestyles also exacerbates this problem.

I’d love to have some kind of toy or simulation that took all of the big facts about our planet and simulated them forward in time so that we could look at the predicted outcomes of our planetary system. What would it take to build such a model? What are the key facts and issues at this scale? What kind of predictive power, even crudely, would such a model have?

Some people have done large models already. Malthusian models of human resource consumption were generally overly negative (failing to consider green revolution impacts and over-estimating population growth) but it may be worth revisiting the construction of models again nevertheless.`

  notes:  
`The Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta is similar to the Louisiana Delta but not quite as well recognized. It occupies about 1100 square miles, begins at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and ends at the bay. It’s been around for about 10,000 years, since the end of the last Ice Age, and was originally a large freshwater marsh with many shallow channels and sloughs surrounding islands of peat and tule. Agriculture has claimed most of the region and now the delta is actually below sea-level and protected by levees. It’s also a source for most of the water supply for central and southern California. There are 22 species of fish including Pacific Salmon, striped bass, steelhead trout, American shad and sturgeon. Of particular interest The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has found that the San Francisco Bay-Delta Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of longfin smelt is a key indicator species for the health of the Delta’s ecosystem. The smelt mainly inhabit the freshwater-saltwater mixing zone of the estuary, except during its spawning season, when it migrates upstream to freshwater following winter "first flush" flow events (around March to May). Because of its one-year lifecycle and relatively low fecundity, it is very susceptible to changes in the environmental conditions of its native habitat. Efforts to protect the endangered fish from further decline have focused on limiting or modifying the large-scale pumping activities of state and federal water projects at the southern end of the estuary. Although allegations have been made that this protection has hurt California's agricultural sector, with the devastation of hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the Central Valley, a 2009 United States Department of Agriculture study estimated that job losses due to smelt protection were closer to 5,000.`,

  notes:
`BP Oil Disaster. In 2010 the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded and sank and a sea-floor oil gusher flowed into the Gulf of Mexico for 87 days. The total discharge was estimated to be 4.9 million barrels. A massive response ensued to protect beaches, wetlands and estuaries. This included skimmer ships, floating booms, controlled burns and 1.84 million US gallons of Corexit oil dispersant. Extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats and fishing and tourism industries was reported. Dolphins and other marine life died in record numbers. Tuna and amberjack exposed to oil developed deformities of the heart and other organs. BP, like many private organizations, has digital simulations of systems that they exploit. They almost certainly also had models of local ecosystem impacts of oil-spills. In either case these models were not public. If there had been civic models then local policy about safety policies and drilling techniques may have been more rigorous or entirely disallowed. If local fishermen, tourist agencies and other regional stakeholders had a clear understanding of the liabilities and even just the economic risks, there may have been much more concerted opposition to the building of these wells.`

  notes:
`The Grand Coulee Dam flooded 21,000 acres of prime bottom land where Native Americans had been living and hunting for thousands of years. Because it lacks a fish ladder the dam permanently blocked fish migration, removing over 1,100 mi (1,770 km) of natural spawning habitat. Kettle Falls, once a primary Native American fishing grounds, was inundated. The average catch of over 600,000 salmon per year was eliminated. In one study, the Army Corps of Engineers estimated the annual loss was over 1 million fish. Chinook, Steelhead, Sockeye and Coho salmon, as well as other important species including Lamprey, are now unable to spawn in the reaches of the Upper Columbia Basin. The general feeling at the time was that the vast economic gains to be derived from the project should not be endangered by the consideration of fish. North of the border Canada appeared to have been truly indifferent to the loss of salmon and steelhead from the Columbia River. The official position was that “there is no commercial salmon fishery on the Columbia River, and hence Canadian interests in that respect will not be affected if the dam at Grand Coulee is not equipped with fishway facilities”. Basically the Canadian government wrote off Columbia River salmon because there would be no adverse economic impact from their loss. Just by way of looking at hidden impacts there are many parks in the interior British Columbia watersheds that have the name “Grizzly” in them; presumably named for a time when these bears populated the region. Grizzly tend to be an indicator species. Similar to now extinct Mammoth and other megafauna the grizzly have a slow reproductive rate and are vulnerable to changes in habitat. It’s not entirely clear what the relationship is between grizzly and salmon but it is known that reduced salmon flows stress grizzly populations. It may very well be that the Grand Coulee wiped out the entire grizzly population in the region and nobody noticed.`

  notes:
`Recently the channel between Lake Merritt and the Oakland Estuary and San Francisco Bay has been re-opened. Lake Merritt was originally a brackish lagoon that swelled and shrank with the tide. It was home to otters, sea lions and migrating birds. However as the city grew the connection to the bay was closed, and sewage was pumped into the lake. The water became stagnant and noxious and wildlife fled. With the re-opening bacterial levels are at their lowest levels in years. Recently osprey and otter have been spotted as well.`

  notes:
`The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has recently decided to allow a Nestlé bottled water plant in Cascade Locks. This was done without public review. Observers argue that although the water rights are held by the State that the water actually belongs to the people. Is selling this particular water a bad decision overall? Is there a water shortage? Would it be profitable to sell the water? Are there any unexpected consequences to wildlife or communities downstream? It’s a complex decision and a model that could test all outcomes may be helpful in arguing for or against the issue.`

  notes:
` One of the main effects of human population growth is Global Warming. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel consumption and other human actions (such as deforestation and cement production) is altering the composition of the atmosphere and possibly a primary cause of global warming. About 80% of our energy comes from fossil fuel consumption (according to Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption ). About 79 million tons of CO2 is released into the atmosphere every day. CO2 is a “greenhouse gas” that helps retain the energy from sunlight as it strikes the Earth. It is naturally occurring and is one of the reasons the Earth is habitable today. Concentrations of CO2 however have increased and there is a correlation between CO2 levels and temperature rise as shown in historical record. This is one of the primary topics that Al Gore has been focusing on with his work on “An Inconvenient Truth” and is of grave concern to any of us who happen to live on this planet. The knock-on effects just from global warming include:

1. <b>Ocean heat absorption.</b> The oceans may be moderating the warming trends overall by absorbing heat from the greenhouse effects. Since they have a vast thermal capacity they can store energy without it affecting us as “directly”.
Ocean acidification. CO2 in the atmosphere reacts with water to produce a weak acid H2CO3 (carbonic acid). This then dissociates into hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions. The hydrogen ions increase ocean acidity. The average pH of today’s surface waters is about 8.1 - an increase of 0.1 pH over the last 200 years.
2. <b>Coral Reef Death.</b> Organisms that make calcium carbonate shells such as coral reefs, snails and sea urchins are affected directly by both water warming and ocean acidification. Overfishing, pollution and development also have a negative impact on reefs. Tropical coral reefs are the foundation of marine biodiversity, providing shelter and habitat for many other species. As well coral reefs provide economic benefits to fishermen and of course are beautiful in their own right. They will likely be extinct by the year 2100 and those entire ecosystems will collapse accordingly according to some reports. About 20 percent of reefs have died in the last few decades already. A single bleaching event that lasted a few weeks in the reefs of Seychelles in the Indian Ocean was responsible for the death of 16 percent of the worlds coral. 
3. <b>Hurricane ferocity.</b> One ingredient for hurricanes is warm water. Usually surface water temperatures need to be over 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit) for a hurricane to form. Science seems to support the notion that warmer temperatures caused by global warming may contribute to more intense hurricanes. Hurricanes can cause substantial damage, especially combined with other environmental issues such as cutting of mangrove forests such as Hurricane Katrina demonstrated in New Orleans.
4. <b>Forced plant and animal migrations.</b> As temperatures increase plants and animals reproduce at increasingly extreme latitudes. In some cases due to geography they have no options and simply go extinct. Agricultural pests also migrate towards the poles as ideal habitats change. These changes affect us as well. For example the Mountain Pine Beetle infestation in Canada helped lower cost of lumber in the United States and this in turn led to the housing boom, and the resultant subprime mortgage lending crisis.
5. <b>Sea level rise.</b> Glacial melting at the poles is leading to sea level rise. Since most human communities are at shorelines, sea level rise impacts can be exacerbated.

If we focus on direct impacts of global warming we see that the Oceans are carrying the brunt of this. This is concerning especially because our seas also carry other human impacts.
